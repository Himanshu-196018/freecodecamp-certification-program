        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Nikola's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1856</span> - Born in Smilhian, the Austrian
            Emopire
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1875</span> - Went to the Austrian Polytechnic in
            Graz. However, he left to gain employment in Marburg in Slovenia.
            After an estrangement from his family, he suffered a nervous
            breakdown. Later enrolled in the Charles Ferdinand University in
            Prague, but again he left before completing his degree.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1880</span> - He moved to Budapest worked for a
            telegraph company. Became acquainted with twin turbines and helped
            develop a device that provided amplification for when using the
            telephone.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1882</span> - He moved to Paris, worked for the
            Continental Edison Company. Here he improved various devices used by
            the Edison company. He also conceived the induction motor and
            devices that used rotating magnetic fields.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1884</span> - With a strong letter of
            recommendation, Tesla went to the United States to work for the
            Edison Machine Works company. Disgusted that he did not ever receive
            a pay rise, Tesla resigned
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1886</span> - Tesla formed his own company, but
            it wasn’t a success as his backers didn’t support his faith in AC
            current.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1887</span> - Tesla worked on a form of X-Rays.
            He was able to photograph the bones in his hand; he also became
            aware of the side-effects of using radiation. However, his work in
            this area gained little coverage, and much of his research was later
            lost in a fire at a New York warehouse.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1891</span> - Tesla became an American citizen.
            This was also a period of great advances in electrical knowledge.
            Tesla demonstrated the potential for wireless energy transfer and
            the capacity for AC power generation. Tesla’s promotion of AC
            current placed him in opposition to Edison who sought to promote his
            Direct Current DC for electric power. Shortly before his death,
            Edison said his biggest mistake was spending so much time on DC
            current rather than the AC current Tesla had promoted.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1899</span> - Tesla moved to Colorado Springs
            where he had the space to develop high voltage experiments. This
            included a variety of radio and electrical transmission experiments.
            He left after a year in Colorado Springs, and the buildings were
            later sold to pay off debts.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1900</span> - Tesla began planning the
            Wardenclyffe Tower facility. This was an ambitious project costing
            $150,000, a fortune at the time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1904</span> - US patent office reversed his
            earlier patent for the radio, giving it instead to G. Marconi. This
            infuriated Tesla who felt he was the rightful inventor. He began a
            long, expensive and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to fight the
            decision. Marconi went on to win the Nobel Prize for physics in
            1909. This seemed to be a repeating theme in Tesla’s life: a great
            invention that he failed to personally profit from.
